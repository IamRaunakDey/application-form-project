# application-form-project
The title of the project is Data Entry Form with Unique Token Generator. The aim of the 
project is to build a data entry form which will generate a unique token number for every data that 
is entered. The above form is created to save the data of the students of a particular institution. 
Given below is a gist of the code that is written. 
The above code is a Python script that creates a GUI application using the tkinter library. The 
purpose of the application is to allow the user to enter various pieces of personal information, such 
as their name, date of birth, gender, and so on, and then save this information to a CSV file called 
data_entry.csv. The application has a number of form fields for the user to fill out, as well as a Save 
button and a Clear button. When the user clicks the Save button, the current values of the form 
fields are checked and then written to the CSV file. If the user clicks the Clear button, all of the form 
fields are cleared. The script also includes some additional functionality, such as the ability to select 
a date from a calendar widget and the use of drop-down menus to select certain options.
